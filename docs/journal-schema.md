# Compile Journal Schema

The daemon writes one JSON object per line to
`<cache_dir>/logs/compile_journal.jsonl` and, when a session opted in,
`<cache_dir>/logs/last-session.jsonl`. This document is the authoritative
reference for the fields consumers (setup-soldr, dashboards, post-mortem
scripts) can rely on.

## Record shape

| Field          | Type            | Always present | Notes |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| `ts`           | string          | yes            | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp of the record write. |
| `outcome`      | string          | yes            | One of `hit`, `miss`, `error`, `cached_error`, `link_hit`, `link_miss`. |
| `compiler`     | string          | yes            | Absolute path to the compiler binary as the client invoked it. |
| `args`         | array of string | yes            | Full argument list, suitable for replay. |
| `cwd`          | string          | yes            | Working directory at request time. |
| `env`          | array of `[k, v]` | no           | Omitted when the client passed `None`. |
| `exit_code`    | integer         | yes            | Process exit code. `-1` is reserved for daemon-side errors. |
| `session_id`   | string \| null  | yes            | UUID for session-attached requests; `null` for ephemeral. |
| `latency_ns`   | integer         | yes            | Wall-clock nanoseconds (per the project's `_ns` convention). |
| `crate_name`   | string          | no             | Populated when parseable from `--crate-name` (rustc). |
| `crate_type`   | string          | no             | Canonical: `lib`, `bin`, `proc-macro`, `build-script`, `test`, `bench`, `example`. |
| `output_ext`   | string          | no             | Derived from `crate_type` — `rlib`, `exe`, `so`, etc. |
| `miss_reason`  | string          | on misses only | See below. |
| `miss_diff`    | object          | no             | Evidence bucket; only the dimension that changed is populated. |
| `self_profile_ns` | object       | no             | Sub-phase timings (`hash_inputs`, `lookup`, `decompress`, `store`). |

## `miss_reason` enum

Per issue #322 every `outcome: miss` and `outcome: link_miss` record
carries a `miss_reason` so consumers can build histograms over a finite
set instead of guessing. The closed set today:

| Value                          | Meaning |
|--------------------------------|---------|
| `context_not_found`            | The daemon has no dep-graph context for this compile unit (cold cache; first time this daemon process has seen the crate). Common when the daemon was restarted between builds and persistence didn't run. |
| `input_fingerprint_mismatch`   | A context exists but the source/header/flag fingerprint differs from the cached entry. The most actionable bucket — points at unexpected input drift. |
| `no_artifact_for_key`          | The cache key resolved, but the artifact bytes on disk are gone (GC'd, never persisted, or corrupted). |
| `version_skew`                 | Compiler version, target triple, or zccache schema differs from the cached entry. |
| `uncacheable_input`            | The invocation parsed but is intrinsically uncacheable or was rejected before cache-key construction (version probes, stdin-only probes, unsupported flags, etc.). |
| `unknown`                      | Fallback. Emitted whenever the daemon detected a miss but has not yet attributed a precise reason. Follow-up work narrows `unknown` into the concrete buckets above. Consumers should still treat the field as present so dashboards don't crash on absent keys. |

Hit and error records never carry `miss_reason`. `cached_error` records are
replayed rustc failures; they are distinct from fresh `error` records and
also omit `miss_reason`.

The Rust source of truth is the `miss_reason` module in
`crates/zccache-daemon/src/compile_journal.rs`. `miss_reason::ALL` is the
append-only iteration of the closed set.

## Issue #256: `session-start --profile` and the extended schema

The optional fields `crate_name`, `crate_type`, `output_ext`,
`miss_diff`, and `self_profile_ns` are populated only when the
session was created with `zccache session-start --profile`.
Without the flag, the journal record uses the legacy lean shape
and incurs zero new allocations on the daemon hot path.

`crate_name`, `crate_type`, and `output_ext` are derived from the
rustc argument vector by the `derive_crate_name` /
`derive_crate_type` / `derive_output_ext` helpers in
`crates/zccache-daemon/src/compile_journal.rs`. `crate_type` takes
one of `lib`, `bin`, `proc-macro`, `build-script`, `test`,
`bench`, `example`; the matching `output_ext` is `rlib`, `exe`,
`so` for proc-macro, etc.

`self_profile_ns` is a four-bucket nanosecond histogram of the
daemon-internal phases for a single compile:

- `hash_inputs` -- time spent computing the cache key inputs.
- `lookup` -- time spent in the artifact/depgraph lookup path.
- `decompress` -- time spent decompressing an artifact on a hit.
- `store` -- time spent persisting an artifact on a miss.

Buckets that did not run for a given compile serialize as `0`.

`miss_diff` is an evidence bucket: only the dimension that flipped
is populated. Empty arrays are omitted from serialization.

The `zccache analyze` subcommand rolls journals up offline and
reads only the documented fields; it tolerates malformed lines
(emits a stderr warning and skips the row) and missing journals
(exits zero with a `(no journal)` message).

## Engine phase profiling

`session-stats --json` and `session-end --json` include `phase_profile` when
the daemon can report aggregate cache-engine phase totals. Use
`zccache engine-profile <stats-json>` to render the hit/miss phase breakdown
from `last-session-stats.json` or captured session-stats JSON. Add `--json`
for the stable machine-readable form.

This is separate from Tokio Console. `engine-profile` attributes cache-engine
work such as hashing, depgraph checks, artifact lookup, output writes, compiler
execution, include scanning, and artifact storage. Tokio Console is for live
Tokio runtime symptoms such as blocked tasks, long polls, wakeups, timers, and
resource contention.

## Stability & versioning

The journal is **additive-by-default**: new optional fields may appear in
later releases without bumping any version. Consumers should ignore
unknown keys. Removal or rename of a documented field is a breaking
change and would require a coordinated schema-version field.

`miss_reason` itself is allowed to gain new variants over time. Consumers
that switch on the value should always have a default arm — treat
unrecognized variants the same as `unknown`.
