# Disk Artifact Cache

The artifact store persists compiled output files on disk, keyed by content-addressed blake3 hash. Uses redb for indexing and LRU eviction.

For how cache keys are computed see [overview.md](overview.md) (section 2.8). For crash recovery see [runtime.md](runtime.md).

## Immutable staged-output rollout

The opt-in `ZCCACHE_STAGED_ARTIFACTS` lane makes the daemon's v2 generations
the authoritative source for supported compiler misses. The compiler is
redirected into a private directory before spawn; after a successful compile,
all outputs are hashed and published as one digest-stamped generation, then
materialized to the requested paths. A failed publication can still salvage a
successful compile from the private files, but it never exposes a partial
cache hit.

Rollout values are `rust` (Rust single and multi-output plans), `c-cpp`
(ordinary single-object and single-PCH GCC/Clang plans including user-owned
`-MF`/`-MD` depfiles; MSVC
flag rewriting is supported only for explicit `/Fo` object paths), or
`all`. Unsupported shapes—including multi-source compiler invocations, C++
modules, unrewritable or undeclared linker outputs, opaque generic exec, and
stdout output—remain on the
legacy path before compiler spawn. Explicit Rust `--emit=kind=path` outputs
are parsed and included in the complete cache-hit reverse map. Inferred
outputs for staticlibs, bins, proc macros, objects, assembly, LLVM IR/bitcode,
MIR, and dep-info use their actual rustc extensions.

Pure archive invocations with one output and no linker side effects use the
same private transaction when the lane is `all`.

Linker invocations participate in the `all` lane when the parser's primary
and declared secondary destinations can all be rewritten before spawn. The
private directory is checked for undeclared files/bundles after the linker
exits, and the requested output directory is checked for external side
effects. Either condition prevents cache publication; declared outputs are
independently salvaged to preserve a successful link.

Generic tool execution also participates in the `all` lane when every
declared output is an exact argument token. Those paths are rewritten into a
private staging directory before spawn and independently materialized after
the run. Generic tools whose output paths are embedded in opaque arguments,
environment variables, or undeclared side effects retain the legacy path.

Published v2 files are always independent copies or true reflinks of private
compiler files. Hardlinks are not used by the staged lane. Requested output
materialization also uses reflink/copy only; this is especially important for
SQLite, databases, incremental state, depfiles, and unknown outputs because an
NTFS hardlink is a shared mutable inode, not COW.

The v2 transaction is visible only after the complete generation and manifest
are written and the per-key pointer is switched. Readers validate the pointer,
manifest, sizes, and every output digest before serving a hit. Startup removes
abandoned staging directories and pointer temporary files. The current flat
v1 and pack formats remain readable during rollout.

## Directory Layout

```
{cache_root}/
  artifacts/
    ab/                          # first 2 hex chars of hash
      cd/                        # next 2 hex chars of hash
        abcdef0123456789.../     # full hash (64 hex chars)
          manifest.json
          output.o               # cached output file(s)
          stdout                 # captured stdout (may be empty)
          stderr                 # captured stderr (may be empty)
  tmp/
    {random}/                    # in-progress writes
  index.redb                     # redb database
```

**cache_root** defaults to `~/.zccache` on all platforms.

## Content Addressing

The artifact directory name is the full blake3 hash (64 hex characters) of the cache key. The two-level prefix directory structure (`ab/cd/`) limits the number of entries per directory, avoiding filesystem performance degradation on large caches.

## Atomic Writes

To prevent partially-written artifacts from being read:

1. Create a temporary directory under `{cache_root}/tmp/{uuid}`.
2. Write all output files and the manifest into the temp directory.
3. `fsync` the temp directory (and files, on Linux, where `fsync` semantics require it).
4. Rename the temp directory to its final path under `artifacts/`. On POSIX, `rename()` is atomic within the same filesystem. On Windows, `MoveFileExW` with `MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING` provides equivalent semantics for directories.
5. Insert into the redb index within a write transaction.

If the daemon crashes between steps 2 and 4, the temp directory is orphaned. On startup, the daemon deletes all entries under `{cache_root}/tmp/`.

## Manifest Format

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "cache_key": "abcdef0123456789...",
  "compiler": "/usr/bin/gcc",
  "compiler_hash": "...",
  "args_hash": "...",
  "source": "foo.c",
  "source_hash": "...",
  "dep_hash": "...",
  "output_files": [
    { "name": "output.o", "size": 12345, "blake3": "..." }
  ],
  "created_at": "2026-03-08T12:00:00Z",
  "exit_code": 0
}
```

The manifest exists primarily for debugging and corruption detection. The cache key is the directory name; the manifest records what went into it.

## redb Index Schema

The redb database contains two tables:

**Table `artifacts`:**
```
Key:   [u8; 32]        // blake3 hash bytes
Value: ArtifactMeta    // bincode-serialized
```

```rust
struct ArtifactMeta {
    total_size: u64,            // sum of all files in artifact dir
    last_access: SystemTime,    // updated on each lookup
    created_at: SystemTime,
    output_file_count: u32,
}
```

**Table `stats`:**
```
Key:   &str             // stat name
Value: u64              // counter
```

Tracks: `hits`, `misses`, `evictions`, `total_bytes_written`, `total_bytes_evicted`.

redb is chosen for its properties:
- Pure Rust, no external dependencies.
- ACID transactions — the index survives crashes without corruption.
- Single-file database.
- Good read concurrency (multiple concurrent readers, single writer).

## Eviction Policy

**Policy:** LRU by `last_access` time.

**Trigger:** After each artifact store operation, check total cache size. If it exceeds `max_size` (configurable, default 10 GB):

1. Open a redb read transaction.
2. Iterate all entries, sorted by `last_access` ascending.
3. Collect entries to evict until projected size is at most `max_size * 0.9` (evict to 90% to avoid thrashing).
4. Open a redb write transaction.
5. For each entry to evict:
   a. Delete the artifact directory from disk.
   b. Remove the entry from the redb `artifacts` table.
   c. Increment the `evictions` counter.
6. Commit the transaction.

Eviction runs as a background tokio task and does not block lookups or stores.

## Corruption Detection

On artifact lookup:
1. Verify the artifact directory exists.
2. Verify `manifest.json` exists and is parseable.
3. Verify each output file listed in the manifest exists and its size matches.
4. (Optional, not default) Verify blake3 hashes of output files match manifest.

If any check fails, remove the artifact directory and its redb entry, and treat as a cache miss. Log a warning.

On startup, the daemon does NOT do a full integrity scan (too slow for large caches). Corruption is detected lazily on lookup.

## Capability-driven COW materialization

The daemon probes operations instead of trusting filesystem names. The first
materialization for a `(cache volume, target volume)` pair attempts a throwaway
reflink and hardlink and caches the resulting `VolumeCaps`. Cross-volume pairs
short-circuit to the copy tier.

The ordered tiers are:

1. **Reflink:** a new file with shared extents and kernel-enforced COW. The
   daemon restores the blob's stored mtime because clone metadata is separate.
2. **Hardlink COW-lite:** the link is recorded by native file identity, the blob
   and output are read-only, and mediated compiler/tool writes copy-detach.
   Each stored blob carries a durable digest so a restarted daemon can rebuild
   the in-memory ledger safely even when prior aliases were deleted. Watcher
   changes mark entries suspect; the next hit hashes the blob and refuses a
   mismatch with warning and durable lifecycle forensics.
3. **Copy:** used when neither sharing primitive is available. The destination
   is independent and writable.

Windows identity uses `GetFileInformationByHandleEx(FileIdInfo)` and its native
128-bit ID, with the legacy index as a pre-Windows-8 fallback. Link counts are
checked before creation so exhaustion degrades to copy. Eviction and `clear`
remove read-only attributes before deletion.

`ZCCACHE_DISABLE_REFLINK=1` disables cloning and `ZCCACHE_COW_READONLY=0`
disables read-only enforcement. Neither setting adds an IPC roundtrip.
Unsupported shapes—including multi-source compiler invocations, C++ modules,
unrewritable/undeclared linker outputs, opaque generic exec, and stdout
output—remain on the
legacy path before compiler spawn. Explicit Rust `--emit=kind=path`
destinations are included in the complete cache-hit reverse map. The staged
lane remains opt-in for output families that do not yet have complete-set
plans.
