# PERF.md — testing zccache performance

zccache has one performance workflow today: **`.github/workflows/perf-rust-cluster.yml`** (the Rust perf cluster). It exercises zccache against Rust workloads by **building `soldr` and `zccache` from source on every run** (plain `cargo build --release` + `Swatinem/rust-cache` + `mold` linker — no soldr/zccache wrapping cargo, that would be circular), then wires them together via the new sticky `soldr update-zccache <dir>` API so the freshly-built zccache is the one under test. A future **`perf-cpp-cluster.yml`** will mirror this shape for C/C++ workloads (clang/gcc + zccache).

For the per-scenario design rationale (what each cell proves), see [`perf/README.md`](perf/README.md).

> **Embedded integration update:** soldr now embeds zccache. The cluster checks the zccache commit under test out inside soldr's vendored submodule before building soldr; the historical runtime pin command is no longer used.

## Setup

No secrets required. Both repos are public; `actions/checkout` reads them with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

If either source tree at `main` HEAD fails to build, the `build-binaries` job fails loudly with the cargo error message — that is the fail-loud signal that the upstream is broken.

### Why build from source instead of consuming pre-built artifacts?

Two reasons:
- **`soldr` and `zccache` are the binaries under test.** Building them with themselves (wrapping `cargo` with `soldr` or `zccache`) would either bootstrap them off prior cached versions of themselves, or measure the bootstrap rather than the cache. Plain `cargo build --release` sidesteps both pitfalls.
- **`main` HEAD is the substance of the test.** Whatever soldr or zccache do today on `main` is what the perf cluster measures today. Artifact consumption would lag by however stale the upstream's most recent dispatched build happens to be (soldr's `release-auto.yml` only fires on releases; zccache's `build.yml` is `workflow_dispatch`-only).

### What about speed?

`Swatinem/rust-cache` caches cargo intermediates per-repo per-platform; warm rebuilds are typically a few minutes. `mold` linker is installed on Linux to shorten the final-link step. The first run on a new platform is slower because both caches are empty.

## How it triggers

The workflow fires on:

1. **`workflow_dispatch`** — the "Run workflow" button in the Actions UI. Dispatch inputs are used verbatim and the branch name is ignored.
2. **`push`** to `main`, `perf/**`, or `evaluate/**`. The branch name is parsed into an effective `(platforms, fixtures, scenarios)` scope (see below). The dispatch inputs are not consulted.
3. **Manual `gh workflow run` CLI** — same as the dispatch button.

The full matrix is always loaded; cells that fall outside the resolved scope
skip themselves at the gate step. `main`, `perf/all`, and dispatch defaults run
the sanctioned full matrix: Linux, Windows, and macOS ARM; `medium` and
`sqlite-link`; and all four scenarios. Canonical `perf/<plat>-<fix>-<scen>`
branches remain the iteration path for a narrower cell.

## Branch-name convention

Branch syntax: **`perf/<plat>-<fix>-<scen>`** with one short token per axis. `all` is the wildcard at any axis.

### Token mapping

| Axis | Branch token | Real value |
|---|---|---|
| Platform | `linux` | `linux` |
| Platform | `win` | `win` |
| Platform | `mac` | `mac-arm` |
| Fixture | `medium` | `medium` |
| Fixture | `sqlite` | `sqlite-link` |
| Scenario | `cold` | `cold-tar-untar-warm` |
| Scenario | `worktree` | `worktree-share` |
| Scenario | `touch` | `touch-no-change` |
| Scenario | `restore` | `restore-no-clean-warm` |
| any axis | `all` | wildcard — run every value on this axis |

The full scope table below is exhaustive for the original three scenarios; for the newer `restore` token, every pattern in the table has a parallel `…-restore` form (e.g. `perf/linux-medium-restore` runs the single cell linux × medium × restore-no-clean-warm).

Short tokens keep the branch name unambiguous (the real names contain hyphens that would collide with the axis separator).

### Full scope table

48 hierarchical patterns plus two full aliases. Anything not in this table
(e.g., a developer iteration branch like `perf/cluster-hierarchical-skip`)
falls back to the full default scope and emits a `::notice::`.

Linux runs on Ubuntu 24.04, Windows runs on Windows 2025, and `mac-arm` runs
on the Apple Silicon `macos-14` image. Each platform builds its own soldr and
zccache binaries before benchmarking.

## Picking a branch for the work you're doing

- **Iterating on cache hit-rate fixes that only affect sqlite builds** → `perf/linux-sqlite-cold` (fastest signal: one cell, the hard gate scenario).
- **Tuning archive fidelity** → `perf/all-all-cold` (sweep cold-tar-untar-warm across everything; fixture variation matters).
- **Worktree path-remap change** → `perf/linux-all-worktree` (every fixture on linux, worktree scenario only).
- **Just experimenting / unsure** → use one canonical narrow branch first;
  `perf/all` and `main` intentionally run the full release gate.
- **Personal feature branch like `perf/wip/foo`** → falls through to the full
  scope with a `::notice::`. Rename to a canonical pattern for a narrow loop.

## Gate semantics

Every scenario gates on **`speedup >= min_speedup` AND (optionally) `warm_ms
<= max_warm_ms_<scen>`** — both must hold for PASS. The warm-ms ceiling is
opt-in per scenario; scenarios with no ceiling gate on speedup alone.

Every scenario is a hard gate. Platform timing budgets are deliberately
separate because runner and filesystem costs differ:

| Platform | min speedup | restore max | worktree max | touch max | staged miss max |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Linux | `4.5x` | `1500ms` | `4000ms` | `2500ms` | `15000ms` |
| macOS ARM | `3.0x` | `2500ms` | `5000ms` | `4000ms` | `25000ms` |
| Windows | `2.0x` | `5000ms` | `8000ms` | `8000ms` | `40000ms` |

The staged miss budget is the sum of hashing, publication, and requested-path
materialization telemetry. Every cell also requires at least one cold staged
publication, zero salvage and critical staged failures, and no more than 2 GiB
of warm materialization copies. Cache-exercising warm scenarios must report an
actual reflink, hardlink-shared, or copy tier. `restore-no-clean-warm` instead
requires zero cache misses. Wrapper compilations that are served entirely as
cache hits are allowed; a miss is the signal that Cargo rebuilt downstream
state instead of accepting the restore as a no-op.

Why both gates instead of speedup-only: some scenarios have cold-side compile
time that dominates the speedup ratio (e.g. `restore-no-clean-warm`: cargo
populates `target/` from scratch on cold, so a real 20× warm regression — warm
going from 75 ms back to 1500 ms — still reports a ~40x speedup and passes a
speedup-only gate cleanly). The warm-ms ceiling catches user-visible regressions
that hide behind a high ratio. Other scenarios (`cold-tar-untar-warm`) want
speedup as the signal of cache contribution and don't currently set a warm-ms
ceiling.

Thresholds live on each `evaluate` matrix row (`min_speedup`,
`max_warm_ms_<scen>`, `max_staged_overhead_ms`, and
`max_materialization_copied_bytes`). Change them only with a linked sanctioned
run showing the before/after distribution; ad-hoc local timings are diagnostic,
not release-gate evidence.

## Reading the run

Every cell appends to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`. From the run page:

1. **Scope** table at the top (`setup` job) — confirms the resolved `(platforms, fixtures, scenarios)` and the source (`branch:<ref>`, `alias:main`, `dispatch`, `unknown-perf:<ref>`, etc.).
2. **bench** cells emit a per-fixture table with `cold/A ms | warm/B ms | speedup | hits/misses | hit rate | peak daemon RSS`.
3. **Evaluate** emits a per-platform table covering every fixture/scenario,
   including cold/warm timing, staged miss overhead, materialization tier
   counts, copied bytes, salvage count, cache counts, and RSS.
4. Failed runs annotate the failing rows with `::error::` lines (visible in the "Annotations" sidebar).

Raw `result.json`, `*-shutdown.json`, and `rss-*.csv` are uploaded as `perf-results-<platform>-<fixture>` artifacts (14-day retention).

## Iterating on a perf problem — local-first, GHA last

When you find (or suspect) a perf regression, the bias is **reproduce and fix locally first**. GHA is the gate; the local loop is the iteration loop. One GHA cycle is 5–17 minutes; one local cycle is seconds to a couple of minutes. Burning GHA cycles on hypotheses you haven't tried locally is the slowest possible workflow.

The flow:

1. **Reproduce locally.** Pick the narrowest scenario that surfaces the problem and run it on the same fixture the GHA job hit. See [Local dry-runs](#local-dry-runs) below for the one-liner. Capture the JSON `{"scenario":...}` line — that's your baseline.
2. **Form one hypothesis.** Don't change two things at once or you'll lose attribution.
3. **Edit + re-run the local scenario.** Compare cold_ms, warm_ms, ratio (warm/cold), hits, misses against your baseline. Iterate locally until the JSON line says you fixed it.
4. **Only now push.** Open a `perf/<plat>-<fix>-<scen>` branch matched to the narrowest cell that exercises your fix (see [Picking a branch](#picking-a-branch-for-the-work-youre-doing)). Watch the GHA run to confirm the local result reproduces on the cluster's hardware.
5. **Iterate on GHA only when you must.** If the bug only reproduces under GHA's environment (older glibc, different filesystem, specific runner image), you've earned the right to push uncertain hypotheses. Note in the commit message that local repro failed and why — future-you will want that context.
6. **Lock the fix in with a perf unit test.** See [Preventing regressions](#preventing-regressions--add-a-perf-unit-test). Without a test, the bug comes back the next time someone refactors the affected path.

The cluster is the regression-blocking measurement, but it is a bad iteration loop. Use it accordingly.

## Preventing regressions — add a perf unit test

Every perf bug you fix should leave a test behind that fails when the regression returns. Tests are the spec: if the perf characteristic isn't tested, it doesn't exist. The perf cluster catches scenario-level cold/warm collapses, but a tight unit test pins down the specific function or path that was slow and makes the future fix obvious.

Two venues, picked by what you're protecting:

**1. Compile-time speed floors (C / C++ / Rust vs bare + vs sccache).** Extend [`crates/zccache-daemon/tests/perf_bench_test.rs`](crates/zccache-daemon/tests/perf_bench_test.rs) with a new `#[test] #[ignore]` benchmark, then add a threshold row in [`ci/perf_guard.py`](ci/perf_guard.py) so [`.github/workflows/perf-guard.yml`](.github/workflows/perf-guard.yml) gates on it on every push to main. The existing rows are your template (`perf_c_zccache_vs_bare`, `perf_warm_cache_zccache_vs_sccache`, etc.).

**2. Function- or path-level budget assertions.** For a regression scoped to a single function (e.g. "session-end took 200 ms when it used to take 5 ms"), add a `#[test]` in the relevant crate that asserts a `Duration` budget:

```rust
#[test]
fn session_end_under_50ms() {
    let t = Instant::now();
    daemon.session_end(session_id).unwrap();
    let elapsed = t.elapsed();
    assert!(elapsed < Duration::from_millis(50), "session_end took {:?}", elapsed);
}
```

Pick the budget at ~3× the post-fix measurement so machine variance doesn't make the test flaky. Mark `#[ignore]` if the test is too slow for the normal suite — `./test --full` picks up ignored tests and CI runs that variant.

**Naming convention:** prefix the test with `perf_` so it's discoverable and so a future cleanup can grep them all. Reference the issue number in a comment (e.g. `// regression test for #320`) — future-you will want to find why the budget was picked.

**Avoid `criterion` / `divan`** for these tests. The point is a single hard assertion that flips a CI red, not a statistical comparison — those tools are for diagnosis (PERF.md → "Iterating on a perf problem"), not regression gates.

## Local dry-runs

### Recommended: Docker harness (`ci/perf_local.py`)

Three-image Docker harness that reproduces one perf-cluster cell on the host
machine without burning a GHA cycle:

```bash
uv run python ci/perf_local.py                      # cold-tar-untar-warm × medium (default)
uv run python ci/perf_local.py --scenario worktree-share
uv run python ci/perf_local.py --fixture sqlite-link
uv run python ci/perf_local.py --rebuild-images     # force docker build of all 3 images
```

Architecture:

- **`zccache-perf-soldr-builder`** — rust:alpine + musl-dev. Builds the
  static `soldr` binary at `.perf-local/binaries/soldr/soldr`.
- **`zccache-perf-zccache-builder`** — rust:bookworm development image
  retained for the local test, lint, formatting, and shell subcommands.
- **`zccache-perf-runner`** — runs scenarios with soldr embedding this
  checkout's committed zccache HEAD and writes reports under
  `.perf-local/results/<scenario>/`.

Source code is **volume-mounted** into the builder containers, and
`target/` lives in a persistent host-side volume — so cargo incremental
recompiles only the crates that changed. First run is full (~5-8 min);
subsequent runs after editing one crate finish in seconds. Image
rebuilds are only needed when a `ci/docker/*.Dockerfile` changes
(force with `--rebuild-images`).

The orchestrator prints the same rich Evaluate-style summary table the
GHA workflow emits, so a local result is directly comparable to a cluster
result row-for-row.

See [`ci/docker/README.md`](ci/docker/README.md) for the full mount layout.

### Bare-bash dry-run (no Docker, Linux only)

For when Docker isn't available and you're on a Linux host that already has
the perf script's deps installed (bash, tar, zstd, jq, plus a soldr +
zccache pair on PATH):

```bash
# Set up the fixture, then run one scenario (writes result.json to stdout)
bash perf/lib/extract.sh medium /tmp/perf-medium && bash perf/scenarios/cold-tar-untar-warm/run.sh /tmp/perf-medium/medium
```

Swap `medium` → `sqlite-link` for the other fixture, and `cold-tar-untar-warm`
→ `worktree-share` / `touch-no-change` for the other two scenarios. The
scripts are POSIX bash and do not require any GHA-only env vars;
`measure::append_summary_md` is a no-op when `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` is unset.

To diff between runs, re-pipe the result.json into a file and
`jq -r 'to_entries | map("\(.key)=\(.value)") | join(" ")'` it — keys appear
in a stable order, so visual diff works.
