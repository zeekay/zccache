//! zccache CLI -- command-line interface for the compiler cache.
//!
//! Usage modes:
//!
//! 1. Subcommand mode:
//!    zccache session-start --compiler /path/to/clang++
//!    zccache session-end `<id>`
//!    zccache status
//!
//! 2. Compiler wrapper mode (auto-detected):
//!    ZCCACHE_SESSION_ID=42 zccache clang++ -c foo.cpp -o foo.o
//!
//!    If the first arg isn't a known subcommand, zccache treats
//!    the entire command line as a compiler invocation and forwards
//!    it to the daemon via the session from ZCCACHE_SESSION_ID.
