//! File watcher for zccache.
//!
//! Provides cross-platform file watching with settle/coalesce buffering,
//! directory ignore filtering, and integration with the metadata cache's
//! clock-based change tracking.
//!
//! Architecture:
//! ```text
//! notify (OS thread) → mpsc → SettleBuffer (tokio task) → CacheSystem
//! ```
